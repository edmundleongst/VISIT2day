<p>The harbor areas and several other historic centres of the city were collectively designated aa UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. The city's history can be traced back to 1207. This is the time when King John of England granted a deed for a newly planned town there. The town’s medieval growth was initially slow.However, in the 18th century, it had expanded rapidly due to the result of profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and had became the second most important port in Britain.</p><br>

<p>The first dock in Liverpool was built by 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established along the Mersey, so that the port outranked London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first to link two major cities was opened. A network of rail providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centres was soon created. Steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were also been established. This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845–49).</p><br>

<p>In the beginning of 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks, but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool’s industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation.</p><br>

<p>Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships.</p><br>
